# BIND DNS Manager - Environment Configuration
# 
# This file contains legacy environment configuration
# The application now supports multiple servers through the UI
# Legacy configs will be automatically migrated to the new multi-server format

# LEGACY: BIND Server Connection (for backwards compatibility)
# If you have an existing .env file, it will be automatically migrated to servers.json
# New installations should use the web UI to add servers (Settings > Manage Servers)

# BIND_HOST=dns.example.com
# BIND_PORT=22
# BIND_USER=root
# BIND_SSH_KEY=/root/.ssh/id_rsa
# BIND_PASSWORD=your-ssh-password
# BIND_CONFIG_PATH=/etc/bind/named.conf

# Flask Configuration (Optional)
# FLASK_ENV=production
# FLASK_DEBUG=False

# MULTI-SERVER ARCHITECTURE:
# Server configurations are now stored in servers.json
# Each server includes:
#   - Connection details (host, port, user, auth)
#   - BIND configuration path
#   - BIND service options (forwarding, recursion, caching, etc.)
#   - Associated DNS zones
# 
# Use the web UI to manage multiple servers:
#   1. Navigate to "Manage Servers" to add/edit servers
#   2. Select a server to make it active
#   3. Configure BIND options per-server via "BIND Config" button
#   4. Manage zones for each server independently
